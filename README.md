# Fallout-Hacking-Game-Python

This python program aims to simulate the word-guessing hacking minigame from the Fallout series! 

There are currently 3 difficulty levels (Looking to match Fallouts Very Easy -> Easy -> Medium etc... system soon)
Simulates printing output line by line, just like the Fallout terminals.

In the future, I'll try to make this a full terminal sim, with text editing, 'Holotape' loading, etc. Just the game for now though.

Just run the game program with Python and make sure the txt files are in the same dir as the game.
